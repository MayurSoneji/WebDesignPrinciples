#Typography and Websites

> It is the typographer’s task to divide up and organize and interpret this mass of printed matter in such a way that the reader will have a good chance of finding what is of interest to him.

> Typography has one plain duty before it and that is to convey information in writing.

> Optimizing typography is optimizing readability, accessibility, usability(!), overall graphic balance. Organizing blocks of text and combining them with pictures, isn’t that what graphic designers, usability specialists, information architects do? So why is it such a neglected topic?

> During the Italian renaissance the typographer had one font to work with, and yet this period produced some of the most beautiful typographical work:

> He should use what is available at the time and use it the best he can.

> Information design is not about the use of good typefaces, it is about the use of good typography.

> A great web designer knows how to work with text not just as content, he treats “text as a user interface”

# How do you choose the "right" font?

Choosing the right font can be a tedious and long task. Based on what we have read before with the article, we can treat typography as a powerful element of what a website contains.

We will be analysing a few websites to get a gist of what we are talking about. If you have any websites that you would like us to analyse, feel free to raise your hand and we will go through the design choices in regards to fonts.

[Hollister](https://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/HomePage?storeId=19659&catalogId=11558&langId=-1&cmp=PDS:HCO_UK_GGL_BRD_Brand-Core&gclid=CIuV5pHH188CFdQ_GwodxxMH-w&gclsrc=aw.ds)

## Hollister

Hollister have used a sans-serif font throughout the website. In some areas the text has been adjusted via it be kerning, leading and upper or lower case. The fonts they use is Source Sans Pro (It is a google font), pfdin and customgothic. The choices the designers have made is overall pretty good. Hollister have used different weights for all the fonts and have kept majority of the page uppercase. The colouring of the font is in contrast to the background they have, this is so it is easier for the user to read and browse through their website. The buttons on hollister follow the same principle of being uppercase.

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk)

## Amazon

The font amazon use is installed in machines automatically, "Arial" is what they use. Accessebility to the font is not an use because of this. Arial is a sans-serif font. Amazon have used a variety of weight depending on the importance of the information and if they would like to promote a service. For example, amazon video is all uppercase and bold, as if someone was shouting the information to get the user to click on the link, or just recognise it is there.

[Twitter](https://www.twitter.co.uk)

## Twitter

Twitter use a variety of weights in the Helvetica Neue family. Depending on the importance of the message they would like to convey, they have adjusted colouring the font and sizing the font accordingly.

[Gumtree](https://www.gumtree.co.uk)

## Gumtree

Gumtree uses the same font as Hollister (source sans pro) however it is different. Like the other websites, they have used different weigths of the family to convey a message. For example, the active state is bold and remains bold. Prices have a larger size and also has the bold weight.

# Choosing a font downfalls

If I were to host a website, I would need to send a font to someone to make sure it looks the same as I have made it to be, in order to accomplish this I would need to send them the fonts so the computer can register this. This is a tedious process which no one would actually do.

Google and Adobe have their own code which is generated should you use their fonts. They have a server which sends the font to the users without them needing to install it. Should you use Adobe's Typekit or Google Fonts, the outcome is still the same.

A google generated code looks like this:

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto" rel="stylesheet">

Google also tell you how to specify it in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

>font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;

If you were to host a website with a font which is not on these websites, you would need to either specify the fonts in your directory and link it to there which can take up space, or you could look around and see if anyone hosts fonts to accomplish the same thing google and Adobe provide.

# To Sum Up

Choosing the right font is down to many things:
* The feeling you want to convey
* Could follow your branding
* How many weights the family has
* Font looks as a whole, whether it looks professional or not
* Is it easily accessible to anyone?
